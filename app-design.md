# App Page Organization

## Home Page
A short description.
Button in top right that says "Begin".

## Begin Page
An option to login or use without logging in.

## Course Page
A selector somewhere to change courses.
A menubar with course sections collapses into a hamburger menu on small devices. Different buttons and stuff TBD.
Courses have download buttons too, or maybe just for individual lessons or sections of lessons?
Use url query for specific course. Use Javascript to fetch course data and populate page. If no query for course, auto select most recently opened course

## Course Builder
Limit length or course (or cut off last part if too long and add "..."?)
Generate uuid, then pick course name and design concepts and problems.
