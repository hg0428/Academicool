# Introduction
This, yet-to-be-named project is a web application savable as an offline application. 
It can be used to give people of all shapes and sizes all over the world the chance to learn for free.
We will start by designing courses in mathematics, and proceed from there if we have time. 

# Login
The application should allow logins and save user data, but also work without logingin, giving the option for new users to learn even without internet connection.


# Offline
The application should use service workers to store the homepage, lesson page, and the selected courses for offline use.
